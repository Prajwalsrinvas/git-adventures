# Git Adventures Documentation Prompt

Great! Now I want to document this Git issue and solution for my Git Adventures repository. 

Can you create a **markdown artifact** with a comprehensive technical guide that has these goals:

1. **Contains everything we learned** from this conversation, but applicable for everyone (no personal/sensitive info)
2. **Verified with web search** - search for current best practices to confirm our approach is correct
3. **Aimed at Git beginners** - self-contained with explanations of Git concepts
4. **Story-driven structure** like a tech blog post

**Structure it as:**
- **Problem**: Story-driven scenario (relatable "I did this and now..." situation)  
- **Understanding**: What went wrong and why (explain Git concepts clearly)
- **Solution**: Step-by-step fix with verification commands AND expected outputs
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and how to handle them
- **Prevention**: How to avoid this mistake in the future  
- **Safety notes**: When NOT to use this approach

**Critical requirements:**
- **Web search first** to verify our approach is still current best practice
- **Show expected outputs** for every command (what users should see)
- **Explain Git concepts** like commit hashes, HEAD, branch pointers, etc.
- **Multiple verification steps** throughout the process
- **Safety warnings** with ⚠️ symbols for dangerous operations
- **Prerequisites section** with backup requirements
- **Step numbering** with clear progression
- **Troubleshooting section** covering at least 3-4 common issues

**Style guidelines:**
- Write as a crisp technical doc writer
- Include code blocks with expected outputs
- Emphasize safety (backups, force push warnings, when NOT to use)
- Use only the approach we actually used (don't suggest untested alternatives)
- Add emojis for visual breaks and safety warnings
- Include "Key Concepts for Git Beginners" section

**Title format:** "The Day I [What Went Wrong] (And How to Fix It)"

This will be published to my Git Adventures repo where I document real Git mistakes and their solutions.
